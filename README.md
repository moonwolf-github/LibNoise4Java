# libnoiseforjava
Java port of the C++ library libnoise. (http://libnoise.sourceforge.net/index.html)

This repository originates from Michael Nugent's [libnoiseforjava](@michaelnugent/libnoiseforjava) fork of TJHJava [repo](@TJHJava/libnoiseforjava).
I decided to detach from it as i plan to modify code in somehow twisted way and it may become uncompatible with original.
